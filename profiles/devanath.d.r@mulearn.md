### About Me

> I’m a final-year Computer Science student who’s always been driven to bring ideas to life using creativity and tech. While I’ve always enjoyed art and design, I’ve also been passionate about building things with technology—especially using AI. I mostly work with Python to create AI/ML projects and keep pushing myself to learn and build more. Right now, I’m the Campus Lead of the μLearn Karunagappally community and part of the GDG (Google Developer Group) executive team. I’m especially excited about AI, 3D animation, and immersive tech—and love working on projects that feel one step ahead of the present.

#### Leadership and Influence:

I’ve actively taken up leadership roles in multiple tech communities, consistently focusing on collaboration, empowerment, and initiative.

- In **2024–2025**, I served as the **Outreach Lead of μLearn Karunagappally**, helping expand our peer-learning network by organizing campaigns and onboarding new members.  
- At the same time, I was the **Management Lead of GDG CEK**, where I handled event coordination, speaker sessions, and logistics with the core team.  
- In **2025–2026**, I was selected as the **Campus Lead of μLearn CEK**, where I currently lead an 11+ member executive team. My leadership style focuses on clarity, responsibility, and treating everyone as peers while ensuring the work gets done.

Beyond community roles, I’ve also led teams in several **technical hackathons**, guiding both the tech direction and team coordination. Notably, we won **first prize at AITHON 2024**, a national-level hackathon with 70+ competitors, and **second prize at IHRD Tharang 2022**. These experiences taught me how to lead under pressure, align team strengths, and turn rough ideas into working solutions in limited time.

#### Networking:

I believe effective networking starts with being approachable, open, and actively involved — and I’ve built my presence that way. I regularly take part in community events such as Tinkerhub Leads meetings and μLearn collaborations, where I interact confidently with peers and organizers. I’m comfortable speaking in front of crowds and during formal meetings, with no stage fear, which helps me build trust and visibility quickly.

Rather than just telling people what to do, I try to **lead by example** — showing consistency, hard work, and positivity in the way I contribute. This has helped me naturally influence juniors and peers to step up and take initiative on their own.

I also create a space where teammates feel safe to share ideas and make decisions. I focus on giving others the **freedom to contribute**, encouraging collaboration over control. Moving forward, I plan to use these values to bring more students into active peer-learning, connect different community groups together, and strengthen the shared culture of Kerala’s tech ecosystem.


#### Career Plan:

In the short term, I aim to gain hands-on experience through internships or job opportunities in the **AI field**, while continuing to build side projects that combine AI, 3D, and AR — areas where I feel the future is headed. These projects allow me to explore bold ideas and sharpen the skills needed to build real-world solutions. 

My long-term vision is to **launch my own startup focused on AI** — something that creates meaningful impact at scale. While my vision is global, I want to proudly start the journey from Kerala, working in close association with the Kerala Startup Mission and the local tech ecosystem. By doing so, I hope to not only grow as a founder but also contribute back by creating jobs, mentoring students, and showing that Kerala can be a launchpad for world-class tech innovation.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

I genuinely believe Kerala has a lot of untapped talent — but to build a stronger tech startup ecosystem, we need to start from the ground level, especially in colleges.

Right now, opportunities are often concentrated around a few top institutions, while many capable students in regular colleges get overlooked. If we want real progress, there should be equal support and visibility for **every college**, no matter its ranking or location.

We also need to focus more on giving students **practical exposure** — like how the market works, what technologies are actually being used in the real world, and how to think beyond just academics. With the right push in the right places, I believe Kerala can produce not just more startups, but more meaningful ones — with people building from where they are, not just where they're expected to be.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

One of my notable open-source contributions is [En Root](https://enrootdefine.netlify.app/), a cultural tech platform I designed and developed to help users explore India’s heritage through technology.Through this, I learned how to structure public projects for clarity and collaboration.

While I haven’t yet contributed to large-scale external open-source projects, I’m actively working on improving my codebase quality and documentation so that others can build on my work. I also plan to contribute to established open-source AI tools and educational tech projects in the near future.

#### History of Community Engagement:

Most of my community engagement has been through **direct, in-person interactions** rather than online platforms. I regularly help my college mates and juniors with technical doubts, project guidance, and career-related topics — especially in areas like AI, Python, and project building.

While I haven’t been active on platforms like Stack Overflow yet, I plan to gradually shift some of my community involvement online to reach a wider audience and contribute back to the open-source and developer communities.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

I haven’t created any technical blog posts or videos yet, but I’ve been meaning to start sharing what I build and learn — especially around AI and AR-based projects. I believe documenting and explaining projects publicly is an important part of learning and helping others..

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

I haven’t built any tools that are widely used at scale yet. However, I’ve developed several working projects like **QMaster** and **Live Object Detection**, which have been shared with peers and used in demos and academic contexts.
